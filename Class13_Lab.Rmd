## Data Set-Up

* We will \texttt{warpbreaks} data in R. 
* Description: The number of breaks in yarn during Weaving
  + This data set gives the number of warp breaks per loom, where a loom corresponds to a fixed length of yarn.
  + The type of wool and the level of weaving tension were randomly assigned to examine warp breaks.
* Format: A data frame with 54 observations on 3 variables.
  + \texttt{break}: numeric, The number of breaks
  + \texttt{wool}: factor, The type of wool (A or B)
  + \texttt{tension}: factor,	The level of tension (L, M, H)
* See https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/warpbreaks.html for detail of \texttt{warpbreak}
  

## 1. What design structure do you see?
```{r}
data(warpbreaks)
summary(warpbreaks)
warpbreaks%>%
  tabyl(wool,tension) # tabyl() is from the janitor package
```

## 2. We will focus on \texttt{tension} as an experimental factor for \texttt{breaks} in this lab session.

### 2.A. Examine the pattern of \texttt{break} by \texttt{tension} using plots
```{r}
ggplot(warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks))+geom_boxplot()

ggplot(warpbreaks, aes(x=tension, y=breaks))+geom_point()
 
(means <- aggregate(breaks~tension,warpbreaks, mean)) # aggregate works similarly to group_by() and summarise() in dplyr. here we're calculating the mean of breaks with in each category of tension

ggplot(warpbreaks,aes(x=tension, y=breaks))+
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(width=0.1))+
  stat_summary(fun="mean",colour = "red")+
  geom_text(data = means, aes(label = breaks, y = breaks + 2))

# way too many digits after the decimal point so will round to 2 
ggplot(warpbreaks,aes(x=tension, y=breaks))+
  geom_violin()+
  stat_summary(fun="mean", colour = "red")+
  geom_text(data = means, aes(label = round(breaks,2), y = breaks + 3),color="red")
```
What is the stat_summary() function doing in each plot?
What happens if you change the number added to breaks in the last line of code?

### 2.B. One-way ANOVA of \texttt{breaks}
```{r}
summary(aov(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
anova(lm(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
summary(lm(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
```
How do anova(), summary(aov()), and summary(lm()) compare?


### 2.C. Tukey's honest significance difference test
```{r}
TukeyHSD(aov(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
t.test(breaks~tension,subset(warpbreaks,tension!="H"))$p.value
t.test(breaks~tension,subset(warpbreaks,tension!="M"))$p.value
t.test(breaks~tension,subset(warpbreaks,tension!="L"))$p.value
```
How do the p values from TukeyHSD() compare to those from t.test()?

### 2.D. Diagnostics for the error assumptions
```{r}
one<-lm(breaks~tension,warpbreaks)
summary(one)
anova(one)
qqnorm(one$resid);qqline(one$resid)
plot(jitter(one$fitted),jitter(one$resid));abline(h=0)
boxcox(lm(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
```
What does the jitter function do?
What (if any) transformation of the outcome is suggested?

### 2.E. One-way ANOVA of \texttt{breaks} with transformed \texttt{break}  

Fit a linear regression model with breaks as a function of tension. Transform breaks according to what you found in the previous question. Reassess OLS assumptions and conduct pairwise comparisons using TukeyHSD(). 
```{r}
one_t<-lm(log(breaks)~tension,warpbreaks)
qqnorm(one_t$resid);qqline(one_t$resid)
plot(jitter(one_t$fitted),jitter(one_t$resid));abline(h=0)

TukeyHSD(aov(log(breaks)~tension,warpbreaks))
TukeyHSD(aov(breaks~tension,warpbreaks))
```
How do the OLS assumptions appear in the transformed model?
How do the pairwise comparisons for each model compare? Any differences?


## 3. Two-way ANOVA of \texttt{breaks} with both \texttt{tension} and \texttt{wool} without an interaction 

```{r}
summary(aov(breaks~tension+wool,warpbreaks))
summary(lm(breaks~tension+wool,warpbreaks))
```


## 4. Two-way ANOVA of \texttt{breaks} with both \texttt{tension} and \texttt{wool} with an interaction 

### 4.A. Graphical understanding
```{r}
ggplot(warpbreaks,aes(x=tension,y=breaks))+
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(width=0.2))+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", color="red",size=2)+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="line", 
               aes(group=wool, linetype=wool)) 
```

```{r}
ggplot(warpbreaks,aes(x=wool,y=breaks))+
  geom_point(position=position_jitter(width=0.2))+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="point", color="blue",size=2)+
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="line", 
               aes(group=tension, linetype=tension)) 
```


### 4.B. Through modeling 
```{r}
aov(breaks~tension*wool,warpbreaks)
aov(breaks~tension+wool+tension*wool,warpbreaks)
aov(breaks~tension+wool+tension:wool,warpbreaks)

summary(lm(breaks~tension*wool,warpbreaks))
aov(breaks~tension:wool,warpbreaks)
summary(lm(breaks~tension:wool,warpbreaks))
```
What is the difference between tension*wool and tension:wool?

### 4.C. Calculate the mean number of breaks by wool and tension.
```{r}
warpbreaks%>%
  group_by(wool,tension)%>%
  summarize(m=mean(breaks))


```
Which combination has the lowest mean(breaks)?

Does this give you enough information to say whether the combination with the lowest number of breaks is significantly better than the others?

### 4.D. Pairwise comparison through Tukey's honest significance difference test
```{r}
# To assess whether one combination is significantly better than another we can conduct pairwise comparisons--making sure to account for multiple comparisons!
TukeyHSD(aov(breaks~tension*wool,warpbreaks))
# the notation of the pairwise comparisons or contrasts can be confusing, you can read it as follows. For M:A-L:A this is comparing the expected mean number of breaks using yarn A with medium tension (M:A) to the expected mean number of breaks using yarn A with low tension (L:A). H0 in this case would be that the difference between them = 0.

```


### 4.E. One-way ANOVA of \texttt{breaks} with \texttt{tension} as a random factor 
```{r}
library(lme4)
rmod_fixed <- lm(breaks ~ tension, warpbreaks)
summary(rmod_fixed)
rmod<-lmer(breaks~(1|tension), warpbreaks)
# (1|tension) means we are fitting as random effect -- specifically random intercept which means the intercept is allowed to vary
summary(rmod)

confint(rmod, oldNames = FALSE) # oldnames = F tells R to use newer, more informative names for variance-covariance parameters
```
