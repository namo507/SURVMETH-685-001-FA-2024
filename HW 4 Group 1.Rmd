### 1. Examine medv as a function of crim, zn and indus in a multiple linear regression.

```{r include=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#create the model
model <- lm(medv ~ crim + zn + indus, data = Boston)
```

**A. Identify the predictors which are “statistically significant” at α = 0.05.**

```{r}
summary(model)
```

The statistically significant predictors at alpha = 0.05 are the crime, residential zoning, and non-retail business acrage variables.
