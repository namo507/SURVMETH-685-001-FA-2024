### 1. JWHT Chapter 2. Modified Exercise 10.

This exercise involves the Boston housing data set. Assume that we are interested in per
capita crime rate, crim.

#### A. Examine crim with summary() and in a histogram

```{r include=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
summary(Boston$crim)
hist(Boston$crim, main = "Histogram of crim", xlab = "crim")
```

#### B. Focus on suburbs with the crime rate above 25. How many suburbs fall into this group? What are the pupil-teacher ratios like in those suburbs? How about property tax rates? How about median home values? How do the pupil-teacher ratios, property tax rates and median home values compare between these suburbs and the remaining suburbs?

```{r}

```
