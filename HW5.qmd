This exercise involves the Boston housing dataset in ISLR2. Assume that we are interested
in median home values, medv.

1. Examine medv as a function of chas in a simple linear regression model with an intercept.
Notice the nature of chas for its use in this and following models. What hypothesis are you
testing with each coefficient in lay terms? Given the results of the hypothesis testing, what
do the coefficients mean?


2. Examine medv as a function of chas and indus in a multiple linear regression. What do the
coefficients mean?


3. Given the results from #1 and #2, what do you conclude about chas and indus in relation
to medv? Support your conclusion with a visualization.

4. You think that the proportion of non-retail business acres may have a different impact on
the expected average median home values in towns bordering the Charles River vs. those that
donâ€™t. Fit a linear regression model with an interaction term to assess this. What do you
observe? Support your observations with a visualization.
